# Tron DID Specification Draft v0.1

## Abstract

This specification describes a new DID method for hosting DIDs on the Tron blockchain, also referred to as Tron DID. This specification conforms to the requirements specified in the [DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.

## Conformance and Terminology

This specification assumes a fair degree of understanding of [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Tron DID Syntax

Tron DID is a URI conforming to [IETF RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986) and **SHOULD** be generated by each entity itself.

Tron DID is generated in conformity with [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The ABNF grammar used to generate the Tron DID identifier is as follows:

```
trx-did   = "did:trx:" trx-specific-idstring
trx-specific-idstring = 40*40HEXDIG
```

`did:trx:` denotes that Tron DIDs are decentralized identifiers conforming to [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and are  registered on the Tron blockchain.

Below is an example of a Tron DID:

```
did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121
```

## Tron DID Registration and Deactivation

Tron DID can be automatically generated without registration for each Tron address.

When a Tron DID is deactivated, all the related data including public keys, controllers, and other properties will be deleted and only a record of the Tron DID identifier will remain on the Tron blockchain.

A deactivated Tron DID can no longer be used and cannot be reactivated for use.

## Tron DID Document

Each Tron DID will have a corresponding Tron DID Document, which is a set of data describing this Tron DID.

Below is the basic structure of the Tron DID Document:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [...],
  "authentication": [...],
  "controller": [...],
  "service": [...],
  "updated": "..."
}
```

### Context

Tron DID Documents **MUST** include a `@context` property.

The value of the @context property **MUST** be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI **MUST** be [https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1](https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1). For more information, see [W3C DIDs specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#production-0).

Below is an example in which the `@context` property has two values:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"]
}
```

### Identifiers

Tron DID Documents **MUST** include an `id` property.

The value of the `id` property denotes the Tron DID subject that the Tron DID Document is about.

The value of `id` **MUST** be a valid Tron DID. A Tron DID **MUST** have exactly one DID subject.

```json
{
  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
}
```

### Public Keys

A Tron DID Document **MAY** include a `publicKey` property to specify a set of public keys linked to that Tron DID.

Public and private key pairs can be used for the identity management, authorization, and verification of Tron DIDs. A Tron DID can be linked to multiple public and private key pairs and one pair of public and private keys can also be used to manage multiple Tron DIDs.

Every public key object linked to the `publicKey` property **MUST** include the fields `id`, `type`, `controller`  and specific public key properties, and **MAY** include other additional properties.

Each linked public key has its own identifier specified using the field `id`. The value of `publicKey` **MUST NOT** contain multiple entries with the same `id`.

Bound public keys can be revoked. Revoked public keys **MUST NOT** be reactivated, but can still possess the original `id`.

The value of the `type` field represents the corresponding public key type. Tron DID Documents support `EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020` and `EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019`.

The value of the `controller` field which identifies the controller of the corresponding private key **MUST** be a valid Tron DID, implying that the public key is controlled by this Tron DID.

The encoding formats that Tron DID Documents support include `publicKeyHex` and `ethAddress`. Public keys of all types **MUST** be expressed in these two formats.

Below is a specific example of the `publicKey` property:

```json
{
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	},
	{
	  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
	  "controller": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "ethAddress": "0xf269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Authentication

Tron DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `authentication` property to specify a set of verification methods.

A Tron DID subject could add the `authentication` property in its corresponding Tron DID Document to denote that the subject has authorized a set of verification methods for the purpose of authentication.

The associated value **MUST** be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method in the `authentication` property **MAY** be embedded or referenced.

Below is an example which refers to authentication keys in the two way specified above:

```json
{
  ...
  "authentication": [
	"did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	{
	  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-2",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "03a835599850544b4c0a222d594be5d59cf298f5a3fd90bff1c8caa064523745f3"
	}
  ],
}
```

### Authorization and Delegation

In a Tron DID Document, an **OPTIONAL** `controller` property is included to assign one or more delegates.

A Tron DID can be delegated to and controlled by one or more distinct Tron DIDs.

A Tron DID delegate has the necessary authorization to insert a new verification method into the `authentication` property of the delegated Tron DID.

It is worth noting that a Tron DID Document can assign `controller` without defining the value of `authentication`.

The Tron DID Document of the delegate **SHOULD** have a `authentication` property.

Below is a specific example representing that either `did:trx:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9` or `did:trx:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2` can act as a delegate of `did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121`:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "controller": [
	"did:trx:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9",
	"did:trx:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2"
  ],
}
```

### Service Information

Tron DID Documents use an **OPTIONAL** `service` property to specify the service property.

Tron DID allows entities to add services and specify the relevant information of a service that is related to the particular Tron DID, including fields such as the type of service and service endpoint.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  ...
  "service": [
	{
	  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#some-service",
	  "type": "SomeServiceType",
	  "serviceEndpoint": "Some URL"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Created

Tron DID Documents do not include a `created` property as Tron DID can be automatically generated for each Tron address.

### Updated

Tron DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `updated` property to specify a timestamp of the most recent change.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#updated).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  "updated": "2019-06-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Appendix

A simple example of a Tron DID Document is as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://www.eth.org/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	}
  ],
  "authentication": [
	"did:trx:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1"
  ]
}
```

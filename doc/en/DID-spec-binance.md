# Binance DID Specification Draft v0.1

## Abstract

This specification describes a new DID method for hosting DIDs on the Binance blockchain, also referred to as Binance DID. This specification conforms to the requirements specified in the [DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) currently published by the W3C Credentials Community Group.

## Conformance and Terminology

This specification assumes a fair degree of understanding of [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Binance DID Syntax

Binance DID is a URI conforming to [IETF RFC 3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986) and **SHOULD** be generated by each entity itself.

Binance DID is generated in conformity with [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

The ABNF grammar used to generate the Binance DID identifier is as follows:

```
bnb-did   = "did:bnb:" bnb-specific-idstring
bnb-specific-idstring = 40*40HEXDIG
```

`did:bnb:` denotes that Binance DIDs are decentralized identifiers conforming to [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and are  registered on the Binance blockchain.

Below is an example of a Binance DID:

```
did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121
```

## Binance DID Registration and Deactivation

Binance DID can be automatically generated without registration for each Binance address.

When a Binance DID is deactivated, all the related data including public keys, controllers, and other properties will be deleted and only a record of the Binance DID identifier will remain on the Binance blockchain.

A deactivated Binance DID can no longer be used and cannot be reactivated for use.

## Binance DID Document

Each Binance DID will have a corresponding Binance DID Document, which is a set of data describing this Binance DID.

Below is the basic structure of the Binance DID Document:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [...],
  "authentication": [...],
  "controller": [...],
  "service": [...],
  "updated": "..."
}
```

### Context

Binance DID Documents **MUST** include a `@context` property.

The value of the @context property **MUST** be one or more URIs, where the value of the first URI **MUST** be [https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1](https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1). For more information, see [W3C DIDs specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#production-0).

Below is an example in which the `@context` property has two values:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"]
}
```

### Identifiers

Binance DID Documents **MUST** include an `id` property.

The value of the `id` property denotes the Binance DID subject that the Binance DID Document is about.

The value of `id` **MUST** be a valid Binance DID. A Binance DID **MUST** have exactly one DID subject.

```json
{
  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
}
```

### Public Keys

A Binance DID Document **MAY** include a `publicKey` property to specify a set of public keys linked to that Binance DID.

Public and private key pairs can be used for the identity management, authorization, and verification of Binance DIDs. A Binance DID can be linked to multiple public and private key pairs and one pair of public and private keys can also be used to manage multiple Binance DIDs.

Every public key object linked to the `publicKey` property **MUST** include the fields `id`, `type`, `controller`  and specific public key properties, and **MAY** include other additional properties.

Each linked public key has its own identifier specified using the field `id`. The value of `publicKey` **MUST NOT** contain multiple entries with the same `id`.

Bound public keys can be revoked. Revoked public keys **MUST NOT** be reactivated, but can still possess the original `id`.

The value of the `type` field represents the corresponding public key type. Binance DID Documents support `EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020` and `EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019`.

The value of the `controller` field which identifies the controller of the corresponding private key **MUST** be a valid Binance DID, implying that the public key is controlled by this Binance DID.

The encoding formats that Binance DID Documents support include `publicKeyHex` and `ethAddress`. Public keys of all types **MUST** be expressed in these two formats.

Below is a specific example of the `publicKey` property:

```json
{
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	},
	{
	  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
	  "controller": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "ethAddress": "0xf269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Authentication

Binance DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `authentication` property to specify a set of verification methods.

A Binance DID subject could add the `authentication` property in its corresponding Binance DID Document to denote that the subject has authorized a set of verification methods for the purpose of authentication.

The associated value **MUST** be an ordered set of one or more verification methods. Each verification method in the `authentication` property **MAY** be embedded or referenced.

Below is an example which refers to authentication keys in the two way specified above:

```json
{
  ...
  "authentication": [
	"did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	{
	  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-2",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "03a835599850544b4c0a222d594be5d59cf298f5a3fd90bff1c8caa064523745f3"
	}
  ],
}
```

### Authorization and Delegation

In a Binance DID Document, an **OPTIONAL** `controller` property is included to assign one or more delegates.

A Binance DID can be delegated to and controlled by one or more distinct Binance DIDs.

A Binance DID delegate has the necessary authorization to insert a new verification method into the `authentication` property of the delegated Binance DID.

It is worth noting that a Binance DID Document can assign `controller` without defining the value of `authentication`.

The Binance DID Document of the delegate **SHOULD** have a `authentication` property.

Below is a specific example representing that either `did:bnb:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9` or `did:bnb:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2` can act as a delegate of `did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121`:

```json
{
  ...
  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "controller": [
	"did:bnb:5Ee76017be7F983a520a778B413758A9DB49cBe9",
	"did:bnb:9861eE37Ede3dCab070DF227155D86A7438d8Ed2"
  ],
}
```

### Service Information

Binance DID Documents use an **OPTIONAL** `service` property to specify the service property.

Binance DID allows entities to add services and specify the relevant information of a service that is related to the particular Binance DID, including fields such as the type of service and service endpoint.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  ...
  "service": [
	{
	  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#some-service",
	  "type": "SomeServiceType",
	  "serviceEndpoint": "Some URL"
	}
  ]
}
```

### Created

Binance DID Documents do not include a `created` property as Binance DID can be automatically generated for each Binance address.

### Updated

Binance DID Documents **SHOULD** include an `updated` property to specify a timestamp of the most recent change.

This part is derived directly from [W3C DIDs specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#updated).

Below is a specific example:

```json
{
  "updated": "2019-06-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Appendix

A simple example of a Binance DID Document is as follows:

```json
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1", "https://www.eth.org/did/v1"],
  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
  "publicKey": [
	{
	  "id": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1",
	  "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
	  "controller": "did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121",
	  "publicKeyHex": "0xfbf38de9fb40edcdab412094d24fa39a314f3d3f52f5860e2509c32522eda30161fe70dfc9f90434d64bd976ede4f112d4f2d8e34d28fe48281663219d2ddac6"
	}
  ],
  "authentication": [
	"did:bnb:f269E60fF7280e3E11b7EEd7B76b5C005105D121#keys-1"
  ]
}
```
